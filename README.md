# Hack Hour Strategy - Auxiliary Objects

## Plan
- We will discuss strategies for approaching algorithm challenges and spot when we might want to use an auxiliary object
- We will see several challenges that can involve usage of auxiliary objects, discuss the concept behind what this auxiliary objects should keep track of, and go over their implementations

## Why Auxiliary Objects?
- Auxiliary object can be actual javascript objects, or arrays, maps, sets, etc.
- This data structure can be used to keep track of information that is relevant to the problem at hand
- This extra data structure can often be used to improve the time complexity of our algorithm
- Using an auxiliary object will often result in worse space complexity as the object takes up extra space. (But usually space is cheaper than time)

## Challenges
1. removeDup
2. union
3. maxChar
4. twoSum
5. nthFibonacci
